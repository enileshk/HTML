Difference between implicit type conversion & explicit type conversion in JavaScript:

| Feature        | Implicit Conversion                         | Explicit Conversion                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -----------------------------------------     |
| Triggered By   | JavaScript engine automatically             | Developer writes code to convert manually     |
| Common Methods | Occurs during operations (+, ==, etc.)      | Use typecase function like Number(), String() |
| Control        | Less control – may cause unexpected results | More control – clearer and safer              |
| Example        | '5' + 1 → "51" (Number to String)           | Number('5') → 5 (String to Number)            |
