In JavaScript, loops are control structures that repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

Loops are used when you want to:

Perform the same task multiple times without rewriting the code.

Iterate over data structures like arrays or objects.

Automate repetitive tasks efficiently.

Type of Loops in JavaScript:
for Loop - Used when the number of iterations is known.
e.g.
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log("Count: " + i);
}

while Loop - Used when the number of iterations is not known in advance.
let i = 1;
while (i <= 3) {
  console.log("Hello");
  i++;
}

do...while Loop - Executes the block at least once, then checks the condition
e.g.
let i = 1;
do {
  console.log("Run at least once");
  i++;
} while (i < 1);

for...of Loop - Used to loop through iterable values like arrays.
e.g.
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
for (let color of colors) {
  console.log(color);
}

for...in Loop - Used to loop through properties of an object.
e.g.
let person = { name: "John", age: 30 };
for (let key in person) {
  console.log(key + ": " + person[key]);
}
