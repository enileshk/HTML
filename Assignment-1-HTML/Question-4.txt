Non-Self closing tag: These tags require data between angle brackets and ‘<tag-name>‘ bracket used to start the tag and ‘</tag-name>’ used to close the tag. 
For example: <h1> This is Heading 1 </h1>
Self closing tag: These tags do not need closure of tag and data is within first pair of angle brackets
