The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface that represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree of objects. It allows developers to access, modify, add, or delete content and structure in a web page dynamically using languages like JavaScript.
The DOM is a tree-like structure where each HTML element is a node (object).
The browser creates this DOM when it loads a web page by parsing the HTML.
It gives JavaScript the power to interact with the HTML document.
How DOM relates to HTML:
HTML	              DOM Equivalent
HTML elements	      DOM nodes/objects
HTML attributes	    Object properties
HTML structure	    Tree structure in memory
HTML manipulation	  JavaScript can update the DOM in real time
