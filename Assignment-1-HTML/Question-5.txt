DOCTYPE stands for ‘Document Type Declaration’. It is used to specify the browser 
About HTML version used so that browser can display the HTML content as per 
Standard specifications.
HTML code should start with DOCTYPE on first line (before rest of tags/structure).

In HTML5, the DOCTYPE declaration is specified in simple way:
<!DOCTYPE html>

DOCTYPE is not a HTML tag, rather it is a specification to instruct browser about 
HTML version.
